			<div class="description"><b>Ici</b><br>Fun place to visit because the store has different flavors each day! The staff is incredibly nice and lets you try as many flavors as you want (as long as it&#8217;s not too busy). I&#8217;ve been going here since high school and I still love it. My favorite flavors include: <b>earl grey, orange chocolate chip, and mint toffee chocolate chip.</b><br><b>TIP:</b> Ici&#8217;s baked alaskas, ice cream sandwiches, and mini bombes are also very tasty!</div>
